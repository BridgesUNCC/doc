# doc

This repository manages the API documentation of the bridges
clients. It maps to `bridgesuncc.github.io/doc`

You can generate the documentations using the script
`docs/make_doc.sh`. You have to be in `docs/` to run it. Note that the
script does not edit the current documentation. This is managed by
symlinks, for instance `docs/cxx-api/current`.
